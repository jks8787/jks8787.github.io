    Hai! I'm <span class="diz-mai-name"><span>Janice Kyla Nascimento Smith</span></span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a <span class="strikethrough">scientist</span> software engineer living outside of Boston working with awesome folks &#64; Americas Test Kitchen.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not working on software, I'm enjoying producing great food for
    my friends and family, taking my dogs on long walks/hikes, listening to
    vinyl or plowing through the latest season of Bob's Burgers.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my former life I was a Biotechnologist working on improving lives with
    science, receiving a B.S. in Biotechnology at the Rochester Institute of
    Technology and my M.S in Biotechnology at UC Irvince.

  <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
  <h3>America's Test Kitchen</h3>
  <p>
    As an engineer on a cross functional team, I embraced working with with product, design and marketing to enhance our flagship products using React and Redux. I architected and assisted in the implementation of JSON APIâ€™s in our Ruby on Rails application while supporting our legacy applications. And I also participated in hiring, supporting and onboarding both interns and associate team members.

  <h2>Associate Software Engineer</h2>
  <h3>America's Test Kitchen</h3>
  <p>
    As a member of the Cooking School platform team, my primary goals were to improve course recommendations for students and overall performance of the application. Working with the senior leadership team we implemented a caching system in our view layer and decreased the response time of our API endpoints using customized SQL statements. As part of this work I drove our assessment system to better offer course recommendations.
