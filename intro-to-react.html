        # what is react?

        * The v in mvc
        * developed by facebook and open-sourced

        ---

        # when to use react?

        * for dynamic sites
        * if you want to use vanilla JS and ES6, rather than learn a new DSL (domain specific language)

        ---

        # getting started with jsx

          * what is jsx
            * JSX allows us to describe our User Interfaces (UIs) in a syntax very similar to the HTML
            * it is optional
            * JSX provides syntactic sugar for the React.createElement(component, props, ...children) function
            * you can catch more template errors at compile time, rather than on page load
            * Making smaller, reusable components is also easier
            * [jsx](https://jsx.github.io/)

          * why is jsx
            * key - React asks for a key attribute that points to a unique ID for each list element
              * To optimize list display performance
            * Synthetic events - Some event handlers (onSubmit, onClick) have different names or implementations in different browsers.
              * The HTML created by your code will be browser specific-  simplifying cross browser compatibility.

        ---

        # behind the sceans

        ## Transpiling
          * babel to transpile it to the supported JavaScript that the browser will understand.
          * babel can convert the code from ES6 to ES5, this is because not all the browsers can interpret our ES6

        ## Virtual DOM
          * the virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI
            is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
          * updating the DOM requires browser manipulation, which is slow
            * updating the virtual DOM does not change the browser (making it faster)

        ---
        # behind the sceans

        ## javascript class

        * a class is a new Javascript feature, added in ES6 (ECMA2015).
        * behaves similarly to classes in object-oriented languages.
        * a class can have a constructor function, which is run on initialization.
        * a class can extend another class with the "extends" keyword.
          * If it does so, it's constructor needs to use the word super().

        ---

        # components

        * components are the building blocks of react

        * A function component is the simplest form of a React component
          * It is a simple function with a simple contract
          ```javascript
              const Button = (props) => {
                    return (
                      <button>a simple button</button>
                    );
              }
          ```

        * A class component is a more featured way to define a React component
          * It also acts like a function that receives props, but that function also considers a private internal state
          ```javascript
              class Button extends React.Component {
                  state = { counter: 1 };
                  render() {
                    return (
                      <button>{this.state.counter}</button>
                    );
                  }
                }
          ```
          * [read more](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#functional-and-class-components)

         # code

         * [open the codepen](https://codepen.io/jks8787/pen/YOvZQQ)
         * we have function component and a class component
         ```javascript
             const Hello = () => (
               <h2>Hello World</h2>
             );
         ```
         ```javascript
             class App extends React.Component {
               render() {
                 return (<h1>Greetings Earth</h1>);
               }
             }
         ```
         * we update the DOM, using a diff of the virtual DOM.
          * First argument is new HTML, second is the element to insert it in.
          ```javascript
            ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
          ```

        # more info on components

          * props
            * props are attributes passed down from one component to another
            * a component's props can be accessed through this.props in the render function
            * functions can be passed down as props as well.
            * [open the codepen](https://codepen.io/jks8787/pen/ZMjoNz)

          * setState
            * setState() enqueues changes to the component state
            * this is the primary method you use to update the user interface in response to event handlers and server responses.
            * [open the codepen](https://codepen.io/jks8787/pen/yxqEPY)

          * state
            * state is set at the parent component, and then can passed down to children as props.
            * a component's initial state is set in the constructor function.

        # es6 - Object.assign
          * Object.assign is new to Javascript with ES6.
          * It takes the first object (usually empty) and then updates it with attributes from any following objects, in order
          * This is a great way to create new objects based on existing ones concisely
          * [read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)

        # es6 - arrow functions
          * Arrow functions are a new, improved syntax for functions
          * One benefit of using arrow functions is that they do not define their own `this`, so you don't need to use `var that=this` with them anymore

        # lifecycle hooks

          * [Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

          * componentWillMount:
            * function called before component is rendered. This is the most commonly used lifecycle hook (AJAX calls, timers)

          * componentDidMount:
            * function called after component is rendered. Useful for third party integrations if really needed (jQuery plugins)

          * componentWillUnmount:
            * function called before component is removed from the DOM

          * componentDidUnmount*:
            * function called after removal from DOM. Useful for cleanup (removing timers, etc.)

          # review of functional and class components

          * functional components - For child components where you only need the render function
          ```javascript
              const Button = (props) => {
                    return (
                      <button>a simple button</button>
                    );
              }
          ```
          * A class component is a more featured way to define a React component
            * It also acts like a function that receives props, but that function also considers a private internal state
            ```javascript
                class Button extends React.Component {
                    state = { counter: 1 };
                    render() {
                      return (
                        <button>{this.state.counter}</button>
                      );
                    }

        # composition vs inheritance

          * composition is always preferred over inheritance in React - make components as reusable as possible!

        # controlled components

        * [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
        ```
          In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select>
          typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input.

          In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components,
          and only updated with setState().
        ```

        # uncontrolled components

          * [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)

          * use refs to store internal form state, and use setState on submit

          * use defaultValue to set initial values in form elements (input, select, etc.)

          * usually not recommended if you can use controlled components (or Redux)

         it is hard to reproduce bugs or add new features.

        # redux overview

        * [docs about redux's three principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/threeprinciples)

        ```javascript
        Single source of truth
          * The state of your whole application is stored
          in an object tree within a single store.

        State is read-only
          * The only way to change the state is to emit an action,
          an object describing what happened.

        Changes are made with pure functions
          * To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions,
          you write pure reducers.
        ```
