            Greetings! I'm Janice K. N. Smith</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I design, architect and develop performant, resilient and maintainable systems as well as support, develop and grow a strong, a self-directing technology team.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently the Technical Lead and Founder of a stealth mode tech startup.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have launched external facing portals to better facilitate communication with external users
            for the Forward Financing team and also developed a common library of components
            to present a unified UX experience for users across the various tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            I prototyped and refined a new React and Redux frontend architecture for relaunch of flagship site of America's Test Kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not working on software, I'm enjoying producing great food for
            my friends and family, taking my dogs on long walks/hikes, listening to
            my tunes on vinyl.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my former life I was a Biotechnologist working on improving lives with
            science, receiving a B.S. in Biotechnology at the Rochester Institute of
            Technology and my M.Sc in Biotechnology at UC Irvine.
