            Greetings! I'm Janice K. N. Smith</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a <span class="strikethrough">biologist</span> software engineer living outside of Boston working with awesome folks &#64; Forward Financing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I help push the boundaries of the current technology ecosystem at
            Forward Financing so we can better serve and help our clients, as well support all our internal teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have Launched the merchant and partner facing portals to better facilitate communication with external users
            and the Forward Financing teamm and also developed a common library of components
            to present a unified UX experience for users across the various tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not working on software, I'm enjoying producing great food for
            my friends and family, taking my dogs on long walks/hikes, listening to
            vinyl or plowing through the latest season of Bob's Burgers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my former life I was a Biotechnologist working on improving lives with
            science, receiving a B.S. in Biotechnology at the Rochester Institute of
            Technology and my M.Sc in Biotechnology at UC Irvine.

              As an engineer on a cross functional team, I embraced working with product, design and marketing to enhance our flagship products using React and Redux.

              As a member of the Cooking School platform team, my primary goals were to improve course recommendations for students and overall performance of the application. Working with the senior leadership team we implemented a caching system in our view layer and decreased the response time of our API endpoints using customized SQL statements. As part of this work I drove our assessment system to better offer course recommendations.
