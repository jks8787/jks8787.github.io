        # Hello!

        # Who I am and my Background:
        I am a founder of Foxglove Technology, LLC and I develop sustainable software.

        I was connected to Kaitlin by a friend and have been acting CTO of beGabbi since November of 2019.

        Previously, I worked as a senior engineering lead in the FinTech and Publishing spaces.

        Before my software career, I was a researcher in the field of rapid DNA analysis,
        and I hold both a B.S as well as M.Sc in biotechnology.

        # Why I joined the Gabbi team:

        I am a maker, a problem slover and whenever possible I want to leave things better than I found them.

        When Kaitlin and I spoke the first time,
        I heard a a person with a great goal and I felt like I had something to contribute to that.

        # Contributions

        To date I have built:
        * a version of the user questionnaire, that will hopefully continue to develop
        * a first pass at a profile/report view
        * a version of communities for gabbi users ( messageboards and threads )
        * a system to recomment given communtiy topics to a user
